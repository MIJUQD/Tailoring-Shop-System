My Contribution to this System :

-	Developed the entire project in C++ by actively utilizing resources such as lectures, professor-provided materials, consulting online materials, and using video tutorials to address challenges and refine the project.

-	Led the team in writing the documentation paper, coordinating efforts and ensuring all sections were completed. Unfortunately, the tight deadline restricted us to refine the paper and improve the code's robustness, particularly in file handling reliability.
